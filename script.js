//Pseudo Code

//Get 4 numbers as input (0-9, no repeats)
//- Alert error if the numbers are repeated
//- if no input detected get input = random numbers
//- Save number
//- hide the 4 numbers from view of player when <start game> button is clicked

//Create 4 input element to get the guess from the user
//Check if the input is the same as the SET INPUT
//- if the number exists in the array, set the background color of the input to RED
//- if the number exists and it is in the correct position in the array,
    //set the background color of the input to GREEN
//- if the number does not exist at all, dont change the background color

//After the check process is done, create another set of elements of the next guess
//Call the fn above and repeat the process until the player has reach 7 guess.

//Keep checking that the input = to the set input < 8 guess
//- If the user did not solve the guess within 7 tries, alert user that he lost.
