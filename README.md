This is my first project completed at GA. It is a game to guess a sequence of 4 random generated digits.

HOW TO PLAY?
1) The objective of this game is to guess the numbers in the computer generated sequence where the numbers can repeat.
2) You will fill in numbers into the empty blanks and check the numbers with the button to match the answers and to display hints.
3) The background colour of the boxes will change to display red, orange or green depending on the numbers you have entered.
 - If your number does not exists in the answer sequence - the background will turn RED.
 - If your number exists in the answer sequence but it is placed in the wrong position - the background will turn ORANGE.
 - If your number exists in the answer sequence and the position of the number is correct - the background will turn GREEN.
4) You have 7 tries to guess the right numbers and its sequence; otherwise you will lose the game. 
5) You can reset the game to play it again if you want to. 

Future improvements: Make the game mobile friendly and adapted to different screen sizes.
